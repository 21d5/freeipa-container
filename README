# FreeIPA server in Docker

This repository contains the Dockerfile and associated assets for
building a FreeIPA server Docker image from the official yum repo.

Install docker 1.2+:

    yum install -y docker-io	# on Fedoras
    yum install -y docker	# on RHEL 7

Start the service:

    systemctl start docker

To build the image, run in the root of the repository:

    docker build -t freeipa-server .

To run the container:

    docker run --name freeipa-server-container -ti -h ipa.example.test -e PASSWORD=Secret123 freeipa-server

The option `--name` assigns the container a name that can be used
later with `docker start`, `docker stop` and other commands.
Command `ipa-server-install` is invoked non-interactively the first
the container is run, and the `PASSWORD` environment variable
specifies the admin password.

You can pass environment variable IPA_SERVER_INSTALL_OPTS with
additional options that will be passed to ipa-server-install.

The `-ti` parameters are optional and are used for get a terminal
(useful for experimenting in the container).

The container can the be started and stopped:

    docker stop freeipa-server-container
    docker start -ai freeipa-server-container

If you want to use the FreeIPA server not just from the host
where it is running but from external machines as well, you
might want to use the `-p` options to make the services accessible
externally. You will then likely want to also specify the
`IPA_SERVER_IP` environment variable via the `-e` option to
define what IP address should the server put to DNS as its
address. Starting the server would then be

    docker run -e IPA_SERVER_IP=10.12.0.98 -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53 \
        -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 389:389 -p 636:636 -p 88:88 -p 464:464 \
	-p 88:88/udp -p 464:464/udp -p 123:123/udp -p 7389:7389 \
	-p 9443:9443 -p 9444:9444 -p 9445:9445 ...


# IPA-enrolled client in Docker

Checkout the `fedora-20-client`, `fedora-rawhide-client`, or
`rhel-7-client` branch, according to your needs.  In the root of the
repository, run:

    docker build -t freeipa-client .

To run the client, link it to the freeipa-server container:

    docker run --privileged --link freeipa-server-container:ipa -e PASSWORD=Secret123 -ti freeipa-client

The first time this container runs, it invokes `ipa-client-install`
with the given admin password.
